    <p>While we were based out of Florence, we did a bunch of traveling around northern Italy. One of my favorite places we went was Cinque Terre, a collection of five cities on the western Italian coastline. This place, while fairly packed with tourists, had absolutely stunning scenery and a fun local culture. It was an absolutely awesome day, and here is the story:</p>
<h2 id="An-Early-Morning"><a href="#An-Early-Morning" class="headerlink" title="An Early Morning"></a>An Early Morning</h2><p>The day started pretty early, as we had a 7:30 am train to catch. This meant no breakfast for us, so the day did not start out well. After a two hour ride to La Spezia, we got on another train headed to our first stop in Cinque Terre. We met a few Americans on this train (like I said, the place was touristy) and had some great conversations there, but getting off the train was where the real fun began. The first view we saw was of a beautiful coastline with mountains and cliffs, plus a sizeable beach. This was the town of Monterosso, and it was absolutely gorgeous.</p>

<p>As we walked through downtown, street vendors were selling locally made art and sculptures while tour groups crowded the streets. We quickly escaped the busiest streets and went up a hiking trail that faced the ocean in search of more incredible views.</p>

<p>Needless to say, we found them. We followed the path up the mountain to an old convent with a small chapel and cemetery, which again had stunning views of the surrounding countryside. It was peaceful and quiet up there, so I spent quite a few minutes simply watching the countryside and listening to the sounds of the ocean.</p>

<p>From there, we hiked back down the hill and went to a restaurant in the bustling downtown area. Frankly, I can’t imagine how anyone drives a small car through those streets let alone a supply truck, but the food was delicious and we were able to try some local cheese and charcuterie.</p>
<p>Once we finishedd eating, we walked around and shopped for a bit at the market. My dad ended up buying a ridiculous hat, but other than that we made it through relatively unscathed. After that, we took a ferry down the coast to the other town we were visiting, Riomaggiore.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0vbfppQ.jpg" alt="Coastline 1"></p>
<p>Riomaggiore was also beautiful. The entire city was built into the hills, so the main way to get around was staircases behind buildings (much to my mom’s chagrin). </p>

<p>It had bustling markets and plenty of restaurants, including a cool punk bar that had frozen drinks. Naturally, we stopped to rest a bit.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rwlEIaP.jpg" alt="Daquiri"></p>
<p>However, at this point we realized that we had done as much walking as we could take, so after we finished our daquiries we left cinque terre. It was a beautiful day at a beautiful place, and that will definitely be a place we will visit again.</p>
<p>As per usual, check out the rest of my photos here:</p>
