    <p>Florence is an incredibly beautiful city, full of history at every turn. All of the architecture is reminiscient of renaissance Italian work, and the narrow streets give you a feeling of getting lost in the old world. With that being said, it was an extremely touristy city. Street vendors holding fidget spinners were at every turn, and just about every restaurant felt like it was targeted at tourists. However, in spite of the massive crowds and touristy feel, I still enjoyed my stay there. Here are the stories of the days I spent in Florence:</p>
<h2 id="Day-0-My-mortal-enemy-is-now-a-suitcase"><a href="#Day-0-My-mortal-enemy-is-now-a-suitcase" class="headerlink" title="Day 0: My mortal enemy is now a suitcase"></a>Day 0: My mortal enemy is now a suitcase</h2><p>The night we got into Florence (day 0, I didn’t want to put that as a separate day) gave me the first taste of the beautiful city. And by that, I mean I initially hated it. We got out of the train station tired and hungry at 9:00 pm from Nice and had to trudge another 20 minutes by foot to get to our Airbnb. Since the city is extremely old, all of the pavement is cobblestone. This might not seem bad at first, but remember the recurring theme about my parents bringing large luggage? We had to drag it over all the cobblestones and all the way to the Airbnb. Halfway through, the wheels on my mom’s suitcase broke, so I had to pretty much carry it the last 10 minutes. At the end, we were all extremely cranky and starving. </p>
<p>However, we soon took care of this problem with some delicious pizza. It was a tiny place with probably only ten tables, but the food was absolutely amazing. I had a pizza with proscuitto and mushrooms, and I ate the entire thing in one sitting because it was so fantastic. We also had a delicious red wine there. The entire environment was familiar and fun, so I would definitely recommend this place.</p>
<p>Once we had finished our pizza, it was around 10:30 and strangely enough, this is really when people started trickling in. It seems that most people in Florence don’t actually eat dinner until at least 9, most of the time at least. Either way, from there we walked back along the narrow, cobblestone roads back to our Airbnb. </p>
<p>The Airbnb was actually quite nice, though it had a strange spiral staircase down to one of the bedrooms. At this point, we were all exhausted so we fell right asleep.</p>
<h2 id="Day-1-Sorry-I-don’t-speak-Italian"><a href="#Day-1-Sorry-I-don’t-speak-Italian" class="headerlink" title="Day 1: Sorry, I don’t speak Italian"></a>Day 1: Sorry, I don’t speak Italian</h2><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HKLTTsH.jpg" alt="Insert Spongebob meme here."></p>
<p>Day 1 started fairly early (though it seems every morning on our trip has) at 8 am, when we woke up to get ready for our 9 am Italian cooking class. Naturally we got lost on the way there, as Florence is a giant maze of streets that really seem to have no rhyme or reason to them. I’m sure that if I was here for longer I could figure it out, but honestly even the major streets felt like back alleys. Although we got lost, we did manage to find a delicious bakery on the way where I got a latte and a croissant. Once we found our way to the meeting point for the cooking class, the real fun began.</p>
<p>The first stop on the cooking class was the central marketplace of Florence, which was a giant collection of booths that sold everything from olive oil to Asian spices. The butchers of the marketplace were the most interesting, as alongside the normal cuts of beef they sold things like whole skinned rabbits, wild boar, whole chickens and other birds, and just about every part of every animal mentioned above, including the heads and feet. It was quite entertaining watching my mom be uncomfortable as she stared at all the meat around her. </p>
<p>At the market, our tour guide told us quite a few interesting things about the history of cooking in Florence. Traditionally, all parts of the meat were used in cooking which is why the butchers sold pretty much everything. Also, wild boar is common around Florence, and so it was a staple of their diet for quite a long time. </p>
<p>Apart from historical facts he also mentioned that there is an art to pairing the sauce with the type of pasta, something I never really picked up on. Lighter sauces, like tomato sauces or butter sauces, tend to do better on thinner pasta such as fettucine and spaghetti. Bolder, meatier sauces such as bolognese sauce go better on wider pasta. Ravioli is the exception to the rule, as the fact that it already has filling means that you do not want a strong flavor to overpower it. These facts were tossed out while we visited a butcher shop where we got fresh meat for the meal, which interestingly was not very lean ground beef. Apparently fatty ground beef is better for stewing.</p>
<p>Once we got the meat, we went to the cooking school where the chefs demonstrated the proper ways to cook the bolognese sauce and the cherry tomato sauce. </p>

<p>Interestingly, there were very few ingredients to these sauces. The main ingredients were olive oil and time, as the sauces had to simmer for around five hours to be properly delicious. </p>

<p>After the chefs finished demonstrating how to make the sauces, we moved on to making the tiramisu. The main ingredient in this dish was copious amounts of arm strength (or an electric mixer, they didn’t let us use those) as we had to whip both the egg whites and the egg yolk-sugar mixture. We then added mascarpone which had to be lightly stirred until most of the lumps were gone, and then finally we folded in the fluffy egg whites. Now the mixture was ready! We each individually created our own dessert, with layers of cookies dipped in a coffee-kahlua mixture and unsweetened cocoa powder. </p>

<p>I got artsy with mine.</p>
<p>We let the tiramisu chill for a bit and moved on to the pasta. For future reference, I am leaving all future dough adventures to the people who enjoy it, because it was an arduous process! It starts with flour and egg, and you slowly work the flour into the egg. That turns into sticky dough, and from there you keep adding flour until it isn’t sticky anymore. Then you knead it, which requires that arm strength again that I mentioned above. But eventually my dough was fairly moist but not sticky, and at that point we set it aside to rise.</p>
<p>Luckily at that point we had an intermission where we tasted some delicious wine (I had a bit more of it than my parents, I was disappointed in the state of my pasta dough) and some amazing appetizers including a balsamic glazed sheep’s milk cheese that was absolutely fantastic. Once our break was over we had to flatten the risen dough and cut it into the pasta, a thinner pasta  and some ravioli that we filled with ricotta cheese. Once everything was cut up, we just had to let the chefs cook it and it was ready to go!</p>

<p>Both items were delicious, and with one final “Ciao!” we concluded our food class.</p>
<p>After a brief return to our Airbnb to change shoes and rest, we decided to walk to the Piazzale Michelangelo. A 30 minute walk and quite a few flights of stairs later, we were rewarded with a fantastic view of Florence. </p>

<p>We stayed up there for awhile to enjoy the view, but eventually we wandered back down the hill and got some gelato to recover. After the gelato, we made our way to the Basilica di San Lorenzo, which has some important burials or something. I was more interested in the beautiful art and architecture. Oh, and the Florence leather school was in the back of the church.</p>

<p>Finally, our long day of walking concluded with a dinner of sushi and sake, which was way too expensive but delicious all the same. </p>
