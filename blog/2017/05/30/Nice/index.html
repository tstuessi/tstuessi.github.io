    <p>The first stop on my international adventure was Nice, France. Ever since I took French in high school, I have wanted to visit this city. In pictures it looked absolutely beautiful, and the real thing did not disappoint. Every street we walked down felt old but comfortable, and every view of the city was absolutely picturesque. There were restaurants and cafes everywhere, plus a beautiful beach and sprawling marketplace. It was one of the most relaxed and comfortable cities I have ever been to (though that might have been because we walked around it on a Wednesday morning) and I really wish we had more time there. Here is the story of the time I did spend there.</p>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>Our first day in Nice was also our first day in Europe, so we were pretty jetlagged. However, we still somehow managed to go eat at a nice French place (my dad hated French cooking, I wanted to convince him he was wrong).</p>

<p>I had a delicious plate of steak tartare, which I've never had before. While really good, I don't think I will be ordering that again due to the texture of it. I also had a fantastic red wine that I forgot to get the name of. My mom had a flank steak that was the best cooked medium well steak I've ever had, and my dad had delicious cod with some sort of butter sauce and peas. Strangely (or at least I thought it was strange) all of our meals came with fries. Everything was fantastic though, and the host was extremely nice.</p>

<p>After that, we took a quick stroll down the Promenade d'Anglais, the main walking path next to the beach. The beach was gorgeous (though it wasn't sand, it was a mixture of stone and pebbles) and we got to see it just as the sun was setting.</p>
<p>We walked home after that, as the tiredness was hitting us pretty hard at that point. I didn't even need to turn on the air conditioning, I just opened the window and the fell straight to sleep.</p>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Waking up that next morning was amazing.</p>

<p>The sun was shining through the open window, the birds were chirping, and the air was cool and crisp. I was still a bit jetlagged from the previous day's travels, but I still felt more relaxed than I had in a long time. Once I finally convinced myself to leave my bed I woke my parents up, and in a few minutes we left the apartment in pursuit of breakfast. We ended up stopping at the bakery down the street, and we had some delicious pastries. I had a <em>pain au chocolat</em> or chocolate pastry and my parents had similar things. My parents also had some of the best coffee I've ever tasted.</p>
<p>From there, we walked down the <em>Promenade d'Anglais</em> to <em>Vieille Ville</em>, or old Nice. The walk was beautiful in and of itself, but old Nice was incredibly beautiful.</p>

<p>It felt peaceful just walking around, and the narrow alleys and streets reminded me of Venice. It had the equivalent of a farmer's market at the beginning where vendors were selling all sorts of fruits and vegetables. I got a box of raspberries and a box of cherries, and my parents purchased a neat oil painting. Overall, pretty awesome market.</p>

<p>After we hit up the market, we walked around a bit more and saw an absolutely beautiful church along with some of the main official buidlings of Nice. Also, we inadvertently climbed up to <em>Colline du Chateau</em>, or Castle Hill, which had some absolutely beautiful view. Climbing that hill was a pretty good workout, but it was totally worth it for the unobstructed view of Nice. The weather was also perfect, so we had a fantastic experience walking around the city.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to a cooking class in Florence the next day, that was all the time we were able to spend in Nice. I would go back in a heartbeat though, as it was a relaxing, carefree city full of spectacular views, delicous food, and friendly people.</p>
