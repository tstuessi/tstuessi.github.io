    <p>My journey to Europe started three days before I actually had to leave, on Friday, May 19th. Since I essentially was going to live out of a box for a month, I figured I should take some care as to what went in that box. The box in question was an old school backpack with a bunch of different pockets, and I was attempting to fill it with the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 pairs of underwear and socks</li>
<li>2 pairs of nice shorts</li>
<li>1 pair of basketball shorts</li>
<li>1 swimsuit</li>
<li>4 shirts</li>
<li>1 fleece sweater/pullover thing</li>
<li>1 towel – Later scrapped this because I didn\’t have enough room</li>
<li>1 pillowcase</li>
<li>1 washcloth</li>
<li>Daypack – small one from REI that compressed well</li>
<li>Rain jacket</li>
<li>Travel laptop and charger – 11 inch cheap one from Best Buy</li>
<li>Kindle and charger</li>
<li>First Aid kit</li>
<li>Medicine – whole bunch of it, I didn\’t want to be stuck without anything</li>
<li>Toiletries</li>
<li>Phone Charger</li>
<li>Headphones</li>
<li>Power Converter</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, this was quite a bit of stuff to fit in your average school backpack. Ultimately, it didn\’t fit, and I had to get a larger one that was organized nicely for traveling. I went with <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/894562/osprey-farpoint-40-travel-pack" target="_blank" rel="external">this backpack</a>, a 40 liter backpack where most of the space is in a single compartment. It opens like a suitcase but is light and comfortable to wear, and it has a pocket in the front for travel documents, laptops, etc. The only flaw in this backpack is that the cover that covers the straps when it converts to a duffel bag has nowhere to go when you are wearing it like a backpack, so it bunches up on your back or it hangs down.</p>
<p>Ultimately the packing process was pretty much finished by Saturday, which left Sunday as a relaxation and spending-time-with-the-girlfriend day. For my last meal in America I went with Mexican food and I got fajitas that fed my girfriend the week after I left.</p>
<h2 id="Flight-1-–-BNA-gt-BOS"><a href="#Flight-1-–-BNA-gt-BOS" class="headerlink" title="Flight #1 – BNA -&gt; BOS"></a>Flight #1 – BNA -&gt; BOS</h2><p>Our flying experience began at 5:15 in the morning, unnecessarily early as I found out later. While I was laying in bed wishing that I had more time to sleep, I got a text from my dad saying that he overestimated how long getting into the airport would take and I could go back to sleep for another hour. That didn\’t happen, as much as I tried. We ended up getting out of the house around 6:45 and through security by 8:00. </p>
<p>We then flew to Boston, which ended up being around a 2.5 hour flight. Overall, pretty boring.</p>
<h2 id="Flight-2-–-BOS-gt-LIS"><a href="#Flight-2-–-BOS-gt-LIS" class="headerlink" title="Flight #2 – BOS -&gt; LIS"></a>Flight #2 – BOS -&gt; LIS</h2><p>Landing began our fun layover in Boston. Since our flight was through a different airline, we had to leave the airport and go to a different terminal. This meant we got to enjoy TSA security again, along with rechecking the bags. Unfortunately it seemed that no one anticipated our arrival so early (our flight didn\’t leave for another 6 hours) so we were stuck with our bags in the lobby as there wasn\’t even a receptionist there for our airline. This wasn\’t really a problem for me, but my parents didn\’t listen to my words of wisdom about only bringing a backpack and thus had two really large suitcases. Luckily the lobby had food, so we sat down for lunch at a place called Jemy Remy\’s. I don\’t think I\’ve ever seen more Red Sox gear in my life, but the food was good and we were able to relax there for a bit until the receptionists for TAP Portugal arrived. </p>
<p>Once we got our tickets, we went through security and got to enjoy the perks of my dad\’s company AmEx card. This got us into the airport lounge, which had free drinks (yay complimentary Jameson and Coke) and free food. This was a fantastic way to enjoy the airport, so I would recommend it if given the chance. We hung out there for a few hours, and at that point I was already starting to get tired. However, I pushed through and we finally got on our flight to Lisbon, Portugal where we had a connector to Nice.</p>
<p>My Dad pulled through on this flight, and we had pretty awesome seats. Typically international flights are eight across, with two on the left, four in the middle, and two on the right. My parents had the two seats on the left of the row in front of me, and I had the window seat behind them. My original plan was to take a couple of Benadryl at the beginning of the flight and sleep through it, but we took off around 7:00 pm so they were going to serve us dinner. They didn\’t turn the lights off until there was around four hours left in the flight, and at that point it was pretty much too late. So, I buckled in and watched Rogue One for the first two hours and listened to the Sherlock Holmes complete collection (narrated by Stephen Fry, it\’s amazing) for the other four hours. It honestly wasn\’t that bad of a flight, much better than my flight to London a couple of years ago.</p>
<h2 id="Flight-3-–-LIS-gt-NCE"><a href="#Flight-3-–-LIS-gt-NCE" class="headerlink" title="Flight #3 – LIS -&gt; NCE"></a>Flight #3 – LIS -&gt; NCE</h2><p>Thus began our eight hour layover in Portugal, which started at 6 am local time. It was around 1 am back in Nashville, so we all were pretty tired when we got off of the plane. Luckily my dad scored again with the lounge, so I was able to sleep pretty comfortably in their resting area which consisted of things that were almost beds. Also, I had my first reminder that we were in Europe as they had around four of the giant Nespresso machines. My parents also slept for a bit, so we weren\’t feeling too bad when we got onto the plane for Nice. </p>
<p>Turns out I was way more exhausted than I thought, and it hit me on the flight. I slept for a solid 45 minutes (which I knew because I was listening to an audiobook at the time and could tell where I stopped remembering the story) and continued with my audiobook for the rest of the trip. </p>
<p>We were finally in Nice, and a cab ride later we were at the Airbnb. The cab ride was the first time I got to exercise my (nonexistant) french, as the cab driver didn\’t speak English. The funniest part of all of that was my Dad, who could easily make friends with a brick wall, couldn\’t talk to the cab driver and it was killing him. He kept trying to look up words like “traffic” and “terrible” so he could communicate but always failed. Either way, after sitting in traffic for a few minutes we arrived at our Airbnb, a beautiful two bedroom apartment in the middle of Nice. </p>
<p>Just like that, we were enjoying our time in Nice! We had a wonderful dinner and walked around which I will talk about in another post, but at the end of the night I was exhausted and I collapsed in my bed. Of course, my sleep wasn\’t completely wonderful because both of my parents got work calls and loudly talked for a bit, but frankly I was too exhausted to care. </p>
<p>Thus ended my travel experience going to Europe. Stay tuned for more blog posts!</p>
